No build step. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with ES modules — serve the folder with any
static server and it runs.

The home page also includes a category-first discovery hub: Reels & Shorts,
Top Actors & Actresses, Suggested For You, provider/network/studio logo rails,
and a collection drawer. Clicking a provider, TV network or studio queries the
matching TMDB discovery filter; clicking an actor opens their filmography. A
small offline people catalogue keeps those rails populated when TMDB is down.

```bash
# local preview
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0
# → http://localhost:8000
```

## Swapping the TMDB key

1. Get a free v3 key at [themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
2. Open `js/config.js` and replace the value of `TMDB_API_KEY`.
3. Reload. The app calls `/configuration` on boot; the console logs
   `TMDB key verified ✓` on success. A 401 shows a friendly banner and the app
   switches to `data/fallback-movies.json` — the UI never goes blank.

> ⚠️ **A key in a static frontend is publicly visible.** Fine for demos
> (TMDB keys are free & rate-limited), but for production use the proxy below.

### Serverless proxy (production)

`api/tmdb.js` is a ready-to-deploy proxy for **Vercel** (works as-is in `/api`)
or **Netlify** (adapter included in the file — move to `netlify/functions/`).

1. Deploy, set the `TMDB_API_KEY` environment variable in the dashboard.
2. In `js/config.js`, point `TMDB_BASE` at `/api/tmdb`.
3. Remove the `api_key` param from `js/api.js` — the proxy injects it and adds
   a path allowlist plus 30-minute CDN caching.

## How playback works (and the `LICENSED_SOURCES` hook)

When a user presses play, `js/archive.js → resolveSource(tmdbId)` walks a
priority chain:

1. **`LICENSED_SOURCES`** (in `js/config.js`) — a hook for streams you have the
   rights to serve. Map a TMDB id to `{ type: 'mp4'|'hls'|'iframe', url, label }`:

   ```js
   export const LICENSED_SOURCES = {
     4808: { type: 'hls', url: 'https://cdn.example.com/charade/master.m3u8', label: 'StreamVault CDN' },
   };
   ```

2. **`data/public-domain-map.json`** — verified public-domain classics streamed
   from the Internet Archive in the native `<video>` player (keyboard shortcuts,
   resume-from-position, ambient glow).

3. **Configurable embed servers** — the player keeps VidBolt as the default
   and exposes a visible source selector for:

   | Label | Movie route | TV episode route |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | VidBolt | `https://vidbolt.xyz/movie/{id}` | `https://vidbolt.xyz/tv/{id}/{season}/{episode}` |
   | VidRift | `https://embed.vidrift.in/embed/movie/{id}` | `https://embed.vidrift.in/embed/tv/{id}/{season}/{episode}` |
   | VixSrc | `https://vixsrc.to/movie/{id}` | `https://vixsrc.to/tv/{id}/{season}/{episode}` |
   | VidLink | `https://vidlink.pro/movie/{id}` | `https://vidlink.pro/tv/{id}/{season}/{episode}` |
   | VidSrc | `https://vidsrc.to/embed/movie/{id}` | `https://vidsrc.to/embed/tv/{id}/{season}/{episode}` |
   | VidCore | `https://vidcore.org/embed/movie/{id}` | `https://vidcore.org/embed/tv/{id}/{season}/{episode}` |
   | VidAPI | `https://vidapi.xyz/embed/movie/{id}` | `https://vidapi.xyz/embed/tv/{id}/{season}/{episode}` |
   | MoviesAPI | `https://moviesapi.to/movie/{id}` | `https://moviesapi.to/tv/{id}/{season}/{episode}` |

   Availability and playback behavior are controlled by those independent
   third-party providers and can change without notice. StreamVault does not
   claim to host or guarantee any provider's catalog. Embed progress/resume
   messages are accepted only from the active provider origin when available.

### Extending `public-domain-map.json`

```jsonc
"films": {
  "<tmdbId>": {
    "archiveId": "<archive.org item identifier>",
    "file": "movie.mp4",        // optional — omit to auto-pick the best MP4
    "title": "Movie Title",
    "year": 1950
  }
}
```

1. Find the TMDB id from the movie's URL (`themoviedb.org/movie/10331` → `10331`).
2. Find the film on [archive.org](https://archive.org) and confirm it is
   genuinely public domain.
3. The identifier is the last URL segment of the item page.
4. If `file` is omitted, `archive.js` queries the Archive metadata API at play
   time and picks the largest h.264 MP4 derivative automatically.

Currently mapped classics (12): Night of the Living Dead · His Girl Friday ·
House on Haunted Hill · Carnival of Souls · Detour · The Stranger · The Little
Shop of Horrors · Plan 9 from Outer Space · Suddenly · Nosferatu · The General
· Charade.

## APIs used (found via [APIVault](https://apivault.dev/))

| API | Category | Endpoint | Key? | Rate limits | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **TMDB** | Video | `https://api.themoviedb.org/3` | ✅ v3 key (`config.js`) | ~50 req/s (we throttle to 40) | All movie data, images, providers |
| **Internet Archive** | Video / Open Data | `https://archive.org/metadata/{id}` | ❌ none | generous; HTTPS + CORS | Resolving public-domain MP4 streams |
| **VidBolt / VidRift / VixSrc / VidLink / VidSrc / VidCore / VidAPI / MoviesAPI** | Video embeds | Provider-specific TMDB movie/TV routes in `js/config.js` | ❌ none | provider fair-use limits | Selectable fallback playback if a server stalls |
| **Disify** | Data Validation | `https://www.disify.com/api/email/{email}` | ❌ none | fair-use, HTTPS + CORS | Newsletter email validation (syntax + disposable + DNS/MX). Degrades to client-side regex if down |

**Notes per the brief:**

- **Authentication (future):** best free option researched on APIVault —
  **Supabase Auth** (generous free tier, email+OAuth, JS SDK, row-level
  security) with **Auth0** (7k free MAU) as runner-up. Watchlist/positions are
  already namespaced in `localStorage`, so migrating them to a user profile
  later is a straight key→table mapping. *Not built now, by design.*
- **URL safety checks:** Google Safe Browsing requires a keyed server-side
  integration and per-key quotas that don't fit a static frontend. Documented
  approach instead: all outbound "Where to Watch" links come exclusively from
  the TMDB/JustWatch provider API (a curated, trusted allowlist) and open with
  `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, so arbitrary-URL scanning isn't needed. If
  user-submitted links are ever added, route them through a serverless Safe
  Browsing `threatMatches:find` call first.
- Everything in this section loads lazily after the hero is interactive —
  Disify is only called on newsletter submit, Archive metadata only on play.

## 19 interface languages

The language menu switches the entire UI across **19 interface languages** —
English, Bahasa Indonesia, Español, Português (BR), Français, Deutsch, Русский,
Türkçe, हिन्दी, 日本語, 한국어, 中文, العربية (full RTL mirroring), Tiếng Việt,
ไทย, Filipino, Nederlands, Polski and Українська (`js/i18n.js`). Every pack
covers the full core key set — nav, hero, rows, library tabs/sorts/filters,
player, account, settings, admin console and toasts — with long legal/help copy
falling back to English. The menu shows each pack's coverage, the
`<html lang>`/`dir` attributes follow the choice (Arabic flips the layout to
RTL), and the TMDB `language=` param re-localizes overviews and genre names
live (`ja-JP`, `ar-AE`, …).

---

## Content policy

The catalogue is filtered automatically on every request (`js/config.js` →
`js/content.js`):

- **LGBT-themed titles are excluded by operator policy** — TMDB keyword ids
  (`lgbt`, `gay`, `lesbian`, `transgender`, …) are sent as `without_keywords`
  on **every** `/discover` call (home rows, library, all tabs), and titles
  reached directly (search suggestions, deep links, hero/Top-10 from trending)
  are re-checked against `/movie|tv/{id}/keywords` and blocked at render /
  play time.
- **Maturity ceiling** (Settings → *Content maturity*, default **Teen**):
  `certification.lte=PG-13 / TV-14` on every discover. Levels: All ages (G),
  Family (PG), Teen (PG-13), Mature (no ceiling). Picking an exact Age Rating
  in the library intentionally overrides the ceiling for that browse.
- Full policy text: [`legal.html`](legal.html#content-policy) — alongside
  [Terms](legal.html#terms), [Privacy](legal.html#privacy) and
  [DMCA](legal.html#dmca), all linked from the footer.

## Owner console

A built-in, admin-only console (navbar → avatar → **Console**, or
`index.html#admin`). It lists every account with name, email, SHA-256 password
hash, role, status, sign-in log, watch history, notices and a live event log —
and can kick, time out (1h/24h/7d/permanent), ban/unban, promote/demote, send
an inline message, reset a password, clear history or delete an account.

A local admin account is seeded on first load:

```
email:    admin@streamvault.local
password: vaultmaster
```

Sign in with it (navbar → Sign In) to unlock the console. All accounts live in
`localStorage` under `sv:accounts`; passwords are stored only as
`sha256('sv1:' + email + ':' + password)` — never in plain text. This is a
client-side demo account, not a server-backed production admin.

---

## Deploying

**Vercel** — `vercel deploy` from the repo root. Static files serve as-is; the
proxy in `/api/tmdb.js` activates automatically. Set `TMDB_API_KEY` env var.

**Netlify** — drag-and-drop the folder, or `netlify deploy`. For the proxy,
move `api/tmdb.js` to `netlify/functions/tmdb.js` and use the exported
`handler` adapter (commented at the bottom of the file).

**Any static host** (GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, nginx…) — upload the
folder. Everything works client-side; you only lose the key-hiding proxy.

---

## Standalone player page (`watch.html`)

Browsers refuse to run a third-party player (VidBolt) inside a *nested* frame —
which is what happens when the site is shown in a preview panel, an in-app
browser or any other wrapper. StreamVault therefore keeps a top-level player
page:

```
watch.html?type=movie&id=550&title=Fight%20Club
watch.html?type=tv&id=1399&s=1&e=1&title=Game%20of%20Thrones
```

It carries the source switcher (Internet Archive MP4 plus VidBolt, VidRift,
VixSrc, VidLink, VidSrc, VidCore, VidAPI and MoviesAPI), resume and the credit
line. The gold nested-frame banner is a setting: dismiss it with the **×**
(persisted) or toggle **Standalone-player notice** in Settings. Two entry
points use it: the **↗ Standalone player** pill in the cinema player, and a
gold notice that appears automatically whenever the player detects it is
running inside a nested frame. No `sandbox` attribute is used anywhere — each
iframe sets `allow`, `allowfullscreen` and `referrerpolicy="origin"`.
